## How to Build

If you decide to contribute then you will be working on the TypeScript files in the `src/` directory. However, we don't export these files to the world, but we transpile them down to ES5 first. We do this by initiating the TypeScript compiler.

But, you can use the scripts provided in the `package.json` file to help you build the files.

```
npm run build
```

It will produce an `index.js` file which can be imported into any project and used.

## Test
```
npm run ganache
./scripts/deployContracts.sh
npm run test
```

## How to Lint

Initiate linting process by calling:

```
npm run lint
```
